### [Seven Steps for Effective Problem Solving in the Workplace](https://www.mediate.com/articles/thicks.cfm)

- problems and conflicts happen all the time and they are opportunities to improve the system and the relationships. They are actually providing us with information that we can use to fix what needs fixing and do a better job
- The most common mistake in problem solving is trying to find a solution right away. 
#### 1. Identify the issues.

  - Be clear about what the **problem** is.
  - Remember that different people might have different **views** of what the issues are.
  - Separate the listing of issues from the identification of interests (that's the next step!).
#### 2. Understand everyone's interests.
  - The best solution is the one that satisfies everyone's interests.
  - This is the time for active listening. Put down your differences for awhile and listen to each other with the intention to understand.
  - Separate the naming of interests from the listing of solutions.
#### 3. List the possible solutions (options)

  - This is the time to do some brainstorming. There may be lots of room for creativity.
  - Separate the listing of options from the evaluation of the options.
#### 4. Evaluate the options.

  - What are the pluses and minuses? Honestly!
  - Separate the evaluation of options from the selection of options.
#### 5. Select an option or options.

  - What's the best option, in the balance?
  - Is there a way to "bundle" a number of options together for a more satisfactory solution?
#### 6. Document the agreement(s).

  - Don't rely on memory.
  - **Writing** it down will help you think through all the details and implications.
#### 7. Agree on contingencies, monitoring, and evaluation.

  - **Conditions** may change. Make contingency agreements about foreseeable future circumstances (**If-then!**).
  - How will you monitor compliance and follow-through?
  - Create opportunities to evaluate the agreements and their implementation. ("Let's try it this way for three months and then look at it.")
