- *Architectural* pattern
- By *decoupling* the app into a series of *independent* components following the MVC pattern, it helps *organize* code for more maintainable project.
- Model is where the applicationâ€™s *data* objects are stored.
- View is what's presented to the users and how *users interact* with the app. 
- Controller is the decision maker and the *glue* between the model and view.
