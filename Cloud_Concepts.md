- Cloud: a Cloud consists of a lot of storage resources with compute cycles located nearby
- Data center: a single site cloud: 
  - servers grouped into rack
  - a rack is a unit of several servers which typically sahre the same power and a top of the rack switch
  - this top of the rack switches are connected via a network topology
  
- Doubling period: same money
  - storage: 12 months
  - bandwidth: 9m; Tbps now
  - CPU: 18m (Moore's law)
  
- Modern cloud features:
  - Massive scale
  - on-demand access: pay as you go
  - Data intensive nature: I/O focus
  - New Cloud Programming Paradigms: MapReduce, NoSQL

- Operating System
  - UI to hardware(device drivers)
  - provide abstraction(process, file system)
  - Resource manager(scheduler)
  - Means of communication(networking)

- A distributed system is a collection of entities, each of which is autonomous, programmable, asynchronous and failure-prone, and which communicate through an unreiable communication medium.
  - challenges
    - Failure: normal
    - Scalability: 1000s machine/ TB data
    - Asynchrony: clock skew and clock drift
    - Concurrency: 1000s machine to access same data

- MapReduce
  - map: processes each record sequentially and independently
  - reduce: processes set of all records in batches
    - by partitioning keys
  - barrier between the 2 phrase
  - Fault-Tolerance
    - node heartbeat
    - Straggler: slowest slows entire; Speculative Execution: replicating slow taks, complete task when first copy finish
    - Locality: same machine > same rack > anywhere

- Gossip
  - Muliticast problem: Group of node(with a piece of info) = proccess
    - problems: sender -> protocol -> nodes 
      - Nodes may crash
      - packets maybe dropped
      - 1000's of nodes
    - approach
      - Centralized: one to many: simplest: UDP/TCP packets
      - Tree-Based: IPmulticast, SRM, RMTP, TRAM, TMTP; Tree setup and maintaince
        - a spanning tree aming nodes; use either ACKs or Negative ack(NAKs) to repair multicasts not received
        - SRM(Scalable Reliable Multicast): use NAKs, add random delays, uses exponential backoff(double wait time everytime) to avoid NAK storms
        - RMTP(Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol): ACKs, only sent to designated receivers, which then re-transmit missing multicasts
      - Third: Epidemic, Infected nodes select B(2) random targets(gossip fan out nodes) -> Gossip msg(UDP) -> nodes 
   - Model:
     - Push gossip
       - Once you have a multicast msg, you start gossiping about it
       - Multiple msg? Gossip a random subset of them, or recently-received onces, or higher priority ones
     - Pull
       - Periodically poll a few randomly selected processes for new multicast msg that you haven't received
       - Get those msg
       - faster in the second half of gossip spread
     - Hybrid
   - Analysis:
     - low latency: clog(n) rounds
     - reliability: most nodes receive msg
     - lightweight: each node transmits <= cblog(n) msg
     - Fault-tolerance
       - package loss
       - node failure
   - Impl:
     - EC2, S3: exchange msg
     - Cassandra: maintain membership lists
     - NNTP: news

- Membership
  - failure detector & dissemination mechanism
    - rate of failure of 1 machine: 120 months => MTTF(mean time to failure)
  - Process 'group'-based system
    - Cloud/DataCenter
    - Replicated servers(P2P)
    - Distributed DB
  - Crash-stop/Fail-stop process failure
  - Virtual synchrony(strong)/gossip(weakly) paradigm
  - Property:
    - **Completeness**: each failure is detected, => 100%
    - Accuracy: no mistake detection
    - Spead: time to first detection
    - Scale: equal load, msg load
  - Centralized Heartbeating: hotspot
  - Ring Heartbeating: neighbors
  - All to All Heartbeating: send to all, mark if timeout of wait
    - Gossip-style heartbeating:
      - Nodes periodically gossip their membership list(address, heartbeat counter, Time(local)), merge latest
      - On receipt, the local membership list is updated
      - thredhold: no increased for more tahn T sec, mark as failed; clean up membership entry time(ping-pong prob);
  - Swim Failure Detector
    - During protocol period(T time unit), random pick node to ping, gert ACK back then fine
    - If no ACK, ping indirect node to send ping to that node agaion <= second chance
    - Time-bound completeness: round robin pinging => permutate
  - Infection-style dissemination
- Grid computing: RAMs model, a DAGs of jobs
  - HPC(High Computation-intensive computing), often federated
  - diff sites run same task
  - 5 stages
    - init
    - stage in
    - execute 
    - stage out
    - publish
 - Computation intensive, so massively parellel
 - Globus Protocol: external allocation, wide area transfer; => Single sign-on
 - intra-site: HTCondor
  
- P2P systems
  - uses:
    - First distributed system on scalability
    - key-value stores uses P2P chord hashing
  - Napster
    - client as peer, quartlly
    - centralized server store meta only, <filename, id_address, port> tuples
  - Gnutella
    - client as a server, store nearby peers info => overlaid graph
    - payload: TTL decrement per node; <<7/10
    - QueryHit routed back from the path
    - use HTTP
    - push: direct or path(behind firewall)
    - ping/pong: 50% traffic; membership
    - 70% freeload: only download
  - Fasttrack:(kazaa)
    - healthier <- supernode, promoted by reputaion(upload/connectivity)
  - BitTorrent
    - incentive for node to provide good download rate
    - tracker(receives, heartbeat)(torrent)
    - choking: limit num of neighbors(best) to upload <= 5
  - DHT(distributed): above systems sort of
    - performance concerns
      - Load balancing
      - Fault-tolerance
      - Efficiency of lookup and inserts
      - Locality: closer by
  - P2P with Provable Properties
  - chord
    - log(n)
    - Consistent Hashing: SHA-1 => 160bit str, truncated to m b
    - peer in ring: know successor's IP
    - Finer table: WFB
    - rounting: #
  - Pastry
    - Routing tables based prefix mathcing: prefix for distance
    - O(logN) lookup
  - Kelips
    - O(1) lookup
    - k "affinity groups"
  
- NoSQL(Not only SQL)
  - workloads
    - Data: large and unstructured
    - Lots of randoim reads and writes
    - Sometimes write-heavy
    - Foreigh keys rarely needed
    - Join infrequent
  - need:
    - speed
    - avoid SPoF
    - low TCO(total cost of opt)
    - fewer sys admin
    - incremental scalability
      - scale up: more powerful machine
      - scale out: more COTS machines
  - API:
    - get
    - put
  - Tables
    - column families: Cassandra
    - Table: HBase
    - Collection: MongoDB
  - Column oriented
    - RDBMS: store a row together
    - NoSQL a column together WFB
    - fast range search within a col
      - all blog_id updated within past month => search in last_updated col, fetch blog_id <= no ned fetch other col
    

- Time and Ordering
  
- Lamport Timestamps
